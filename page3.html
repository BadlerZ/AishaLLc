            Don’t Dream it, build it<br>
            <br>
            All men dream; but not equally. Those who dream by night in the dusty recesses of their minds Awake to find that it was vanity; But the dreamers of day are dangerous men. That they may act their dreams with open eyes to make it possible.

            We have been building Zs for decades, with all of the blood sweat and tears that entails. It has given us a feeling of what’s fun, like the ease of changing your own oil and spark plugs, and even adjusting valvetrain lash, (don’t worry, the car will actually guide you through routine maintenance, and all you need are some simple service ramps and a few simple tools included with each AiSha) and what’s no fun, like chasing a bad ground to solve an intermittent short, or cutting into a cocoon of ancient electrical tape to replace a failing relay. That is why a modern ECU and PMU combination gives each AiSha modern car reliability, and specific information and advice if anything goes (seriously, if you put enough miles on in that time period that you need an engine rebuild, we would love to tear it down at that point and rebuild it for you, we could learn something).
            <br><br>We also don’t make you wait forever. Once you get to the front of the line, we promise to have your car finished in months, not years. We only start the build once engines and other major components are on hand. We go through a few sessions to faithfully turn your dream into a plan, then get to work. Even more importantly, you can rest assured that when you get your finished Z that is it. Everything you could ever want in a 240Z is there. It’s truly FINISHED.
            <br><br>An AiSha will never require anything but basic maintenance to give you years of unparalleled connection behind the wheel.
