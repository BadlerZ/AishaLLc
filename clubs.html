            我が盃をあふれしめたまふ
            <br><br>We’re not waiting ten years to do a turbo, and we are doing turbos differently. Unless your goal is doing 200mph+ on Tokyo’s Wangan expressway, you don’t need 600 horsepower, and frankly you wouldn’t want it in a car so light. Our turbocharger is sized just right, and we went to the trouble of designing a liquid-air intercooler to shorten the intake piping as much as possible and give almost instant throttle response.
            <br><br>The blow-though carburetors are an aural sensation. A decade ago when Mayumi had a similar setup, Badler described the sound as “God’s private jet, taking off”. Through the brilliance of the HKS plenum, as boost increases, so does the richness of the mixture! And just in case, the engine is equipped with two knock sensors, directly hooked to the ECU to prevent damage at the first sign of trouble.
            <br><br>The styling on the♣Spec with its long nose and aggressive aero is bold but not ostentatious. It is a serious grand touring car, that will swaddle you in luxury as you cruise across the country, not just some silly toy to show off at cars and coffee.
            <br><br>The Sound System
            <br><br>Is AWESOME
            <br><br>It obviously has a super great and over the top interior in ways that will be specified later
            <br><br>It just turned midnight, goodnight
