            It must be something that ignites passion in the people who drive it.”<br>

            Recent trends in the auto industry from lane keeping assist to full self driving robotaxis, have taken steps away from driver engagement, treating driving as a chore that they want to lighten the burden of. Here at AiSha LLC, we still remember the joy. The excitement of first getting behind the wheel. That sense of accomplishment when you go from “sorta knowing how to drive stick” to feeling the manual transmission as an extension of yourself. Sure, there are technically faster, more efficient ways to get from point A to point B, but if you know what we know, you know that isn’t the point.
            <br><br>AiSha will give you the perfect car to fall in love with, and for the first time ever, the car will really love you back. Our patent-pending Soul Interface will connect you to your AiSha in ways you never imagined possible. We would say more, but then our lawyer would get angry at us. You’ll just have to wait and see.
            <br><br>We aren’t owned by private equity, and never will be, so making automotive art will always come before maximizing profits. What would AiSha be without the love? We source our full builds from barn finds and abandoned projects, trying to get cars back on the road after many decades that they might otherwise keep sitting, because, we really love the 240Z. If you don’t yet, you will.
