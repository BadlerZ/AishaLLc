            Feel like you’re just a regular Z enthusiast who somehow wound up on a site selling unobtainium? Do you already have a Z you love and just wish you could drive more? Did you just get yours repainted? Are you working on that awesome patina and you’re never going to paint it? ❤️ Spec may be just the thing for you. (Also to be clear we will not paint your car) This BYOZ offering is our way here at AiSha of giving back to the Z community.
            <br><br>First, let's get this straight, we are NOT a repair shop and will not fix your Z. You need to get it to AiSha LLC headquarters with its engine running, and not leaking fluids of any kind. On the other hand, it doesn’t matter if none of the lights or gauges work, because afterwards we guarantee they will. We carefully disassemble your Z (you can even help with this part if you like), entirely removing the dash and pulling out all of the old, unreliable fuses and relays, this continues under the hood, replacing your old rat’s nest with beautiful wraps and a sleek coil on plug system, complete with dual knock sensors.
            <br><br>Then, it all comes back together with a brand new ECU and power management unit that replaces every fuse and relay in the car. The HVAC system is upgraded to the same unit used in all our other builds. No-idle electric compressor, ice-cold A/C is an option, but if you already have a modern belt-driven AC compressor, or simply prefer one, we can work with that.
            <br><br>You will get the same trademark AiSha center console with its warm neon glow that you see in all of our cars, with a real wood veneer and all-metal switches, buttons and dials for that satisfying touch. Behind the beautiful veneer is a high quality AM/FM radio, seamless bluetooth connection, USB-C input, and a DAC capable of transmitting a high fidelity analog signal to the amplifier and speakers you already have, or the ones we help you select. And yes, like all other AiSha, you get its samurai arrowhead soul. (Full Soul Interfaces are optional. Leave out for now)
            <br><br>When it’s all finished, after just a few short weeks, you can come get your Z and drive it home, even if you live in Florida. Every heart spec will be a re-liable, comfortable, highway cruiser with modern connectivity ready to put down thousands of miles over the course of a year, or all at once. And all of our components are covered by our 5 year warranty.
            <br><br>Heart spec conversions are reserved for those who truly love their old Z. They are meant to be obtainable (but after reading above what goes into them, please don’t expect them to be cheap). As the time in shop is typically under a month, and the last thing we would ever want to do is take a lien out against a beloved Z, full payment is required upfront for ❤️ Spec. L-series Nissan engines only. Carburetors are great. Invitation only.
