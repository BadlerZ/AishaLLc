            The Espada ♠️ Spec is no shovel, but, in going back to the origins of the suit, a sword, a beautiful, razor-sharp blade, born to cut lap times.
            <br><br>At it’s heart beats a sturdy Nissan LD Stroker Crank, fully forged and expertly balanced internals, a free flowing well-ported head with the biggest valves that can fit, and the legendary Kameari Type A camshaft. Fueled by stunning Mikuni 50PHH carburetors, with their unparalleled style and sound, ignition is precisely managed by a HAL sensor triggered coil on plug setup using R35 GT-R coils fired by a cutting edge ECU, and dual Bosch knock sensors to allow the performance envelope to be safely and reliably pushed. Mated to the a brand-new NISMO close-ratio 6 speed transmission, which sends power through a limited slip differential, and ultimately sturdy CV axles. Every part of the drivetrain is designed to stand up to hard track use, and covered by our 5 year warranty.
            <br><br>For brakes and suspension, we believe that synergy is important, so we source nearly everything from our good friends at Techno Toy Tuning. This means that almost everything on the car that wasn’t originally made in Japan was made here in America, not cheap knockoffs. From steering racks to control arms to wheel hubs, we don’t rely on remanufactured parts or dubious old stock, it is all brand new, and largely improved.
            <br><br>Worried about blemishing such a beauty? Don’t be. Every ♠️ Spec is delivered with the outside fully wrapped in high quality, clear, paint protection film. Stray rocks glance off, oil and paint beads up and rolls off. The front splitter, side skirt extensions, and fender flares are deliberately not covered, and are easily removed in case “race happens” and they need a little touch up or even a simple fiberglass repair afterwards. Seriously, take this car to the circuit, you’ll be glad you did.
            <br><br>The ♠️ Spec features AiSha’s world-first Total Trackside Weight Reduction System(TTWRS). Like other AiSha it features a hydraulic lift system to allow you to set optimal track ride height, while fearing no driveway and cresting speedbumps with ease. An audiophile sound system with 6 hand-made Focal speakers plus a dedicated subwoofer so you can really feel the bass. An electric air conditioner with a compact 200Ah lithium battery that complements the Antigravity starter battery, to allow no-idle cooling. What sets the Espada apart is that the subwoofer, woofer boxes, amplifier, crossovers, hydraulic pump, AC Compressor, 200Ah battery and passenger seat can all be removed in under five minutes and left at the paddock while you lap, adding up to a weight savings of over 100 pounds. Then when it is time to go back home, everything is hooked back up just as easily with no tools. Fun at the track with no need for a truck and trailer. Have your cake and eat it too.
