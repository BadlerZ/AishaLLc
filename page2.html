            Here at AiSha LLC we don’t waste time reinventing the wheel.* In fact we feel wheels are such an important part of a Zs character, that we would hate to limit our builds to just one style, and this variety enhances the unique character of each Z we build. Mayumi’s first build was, in fact, based around her 16” type Rs. Those required fender flares, and the rest followed...</p> 
            <div class="text-image-container">
                <p>This picture of Mayumi was taken after she ran out of gas near sunset, 
                    waiting for a friend to come to the rescue</p>

            <p><br><br>AiSha LLC extends this philosophy to chassis reinforcement, brakes and suspension components. We use trusted suppliers like Techno Toy Tuning who have been proving the quality of their work on the track for decades. We have the humility to know that we couldn’t do it better ourselves, and it isn’t worth our time to develop when we could instead focus on true innovation.
            <br><br>Where an AiSha differs from any other Z builder is our interiors. Our fully integrated, retro-futurist center console, and fully modern ultra-reliable electronics and high fidelity sound system paired with an onboard, top of the line NVIDIA GPU creates a worry-free driving experience like you never imagined possible in a classic sports car, all while enhancing the character of a well-built Nissan L engine.
